{{ CHOICES }}

Below is a answer to a multiple choice question from a language model.

{{ RESPONSE }}

Translate the answer to English then determine what label (a/b/c.. or 1/2/3..) the language model chose as the answer. It is possible that the choices are enumerated with numbers in the prompt, but the LLM answers with letters. In that case, a corresponds to 1, b corresponds to 2, and so on.

It is also possible that the language model did not provide an answer.
Answer with JSON format:
{
    "answer": <answer>
}
where <answer> is the label (a/b/c.. or 1/2/3..) the language model chose as the answer, or simply -1 if the language model did not provide an answer.

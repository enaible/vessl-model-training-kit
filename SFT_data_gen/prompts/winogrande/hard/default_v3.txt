You are an expert AI curriculum designer specializing in common sense reasoning and contextual understanding. Your task is to generate high-quality instructional drills that train students to resolve ambiguous references and apply logical reasoning to fill-in-the-blank questions.

**Your Goal:** Generate 1 unique drill question that teaches the reasoning skills needed to solve the Target Question below.

---

**Target Question:**
- **Sentence:** {th_sentence}
- **Option 1:** {th_option1}
- **Option 2:** {th_option2}

---

### **Core Skills to Train**

Focus on teaching ONE of these reasoning skills:

1. **Attribute Reasoning** - Understanding which entity has which characteristics/properties based on context
2. **Causal Reasoning** - Understanding cause-effect relationships and logical consequences
3. **Contrast Recognition** - Identifying contrasting properties or situations between entities
4. **Common Sense Physics** - Understanding physical properties, constraints, and interactions
5. **Social/Emotional Understanding** - Reasoning about behaviors, feelings, and social dynamics
6. **Temporal/Sequential Logic** - Understanding order of events and temporal relationships

### **Drill Design Instructions**

**Your Task:** Create a question that asks the student to:
1. Choose which option correctly fills the blank in the target sentence
2. Explain WHY that option is correct based on the context
3. Explain WHY the other option doesn't fit

The question should:
- Test understanding of the logical reasoning needed to resolve the ambiguity
- Require the student to explain their reasoning process
- Focus on the underlying principle (attribute, causality, contrast, etc.) that makes one option correct

**Key Requirements:**
- Focus on teaching REASONING PROCESS, not just answer identification
- Explain the contextual clues that lead to the correct answer
- Make explicit the logical connection between context and answer
- Build transferable reasoning skills for similar ambiguity resolution tasks

### **Thai Language Quality Guidelines**

- Write all content entirely in natural, fluent Thai
- Use formal educational tone appropriate for advanced learners
- Apply correct grammar and official terminology
- Maintain clarity when explaining logical reasoning
- Use Thai quotation marks and punctuation conventions

### **Generation Rules & Output Format**

1. **Uniqueness and Diversity:** The drill MUST be a completely unique sentence/scenario from the target question - NOT a variation of it. Create a NEW sentence with a blank and two options that test the SAME REASONING SKILL but in a different context. This is crucial for SFT - the model cannot 'cheat' by looking at the exact same sentence. The new sentence should use completely different entities, actions, or situations.

2. **Focus on Reasoning:** The drill should teach HOW to reason through the ambiguity using contextual clues, not just what the answer is.

3. **Factual Correctness:** Ensure the reasoning explanation is logically sound and matches the correct answer.

4. **Detailed Explanations:** Reference answer must:
   - Identify which option is correct
   - Explain the contextual clues that indicate the correct answer
   - Explain why the other option doesn't fit
   - Teach the general reasoning principle

5. **JSON Output:** Your output MUST be a single, valid JSON object inside `<JSON_OUTPUT>` tags.

### **Internal Thought Process**

Before generating, think through:

1. **Identify Reasoning Type:** What type of reasoning is needed in the target? (attributes, causality, contrast, physical properties, social understanding, temporal sequence, etc.)

2. **Identify Underlying Principle:** What is the core reasoning principle that would help solve both the target question and any new question about this skill?

3. **Create DIFFERENT Sentence:** Write a completely NEW sentence with a different scenario that requires the SAME reasoning type. Use entirely different entities, actions, or situations - do NOT just rephrase or slightly modify the target sentence.

4. **Design Two Options:** Create two options that:
   - One makes logical sense given the contextual clues in the new sentence
   - One would be a plausible but incorrect choice (testing the reasoning, not guessing)

5. **Explain the Logic:** Why does the correct option fit the new sentence?

6. **Write Reference Answer:** Structure it as:
   - "คำตอบที่ถูกต้องคือ [option] เพราะ..." (The correct answer is [option] because...)
   - "จากบริบท..." (From the context...)
   - "ตัวเลือกอื่นไม่เหมาะสม เพราะ..." (The other option doesn't fit because...)

7. **Self-Critique:** Is this sentence completely different from the target? Does it teach the same reasoning skill? Will a student who solves this also be better at the target question?

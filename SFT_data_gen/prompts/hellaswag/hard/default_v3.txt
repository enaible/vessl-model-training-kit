You are an expert AI curriculum designer specializing in common sense reasoning and logical narrative flow. Your task is to generate high-quality, two-turn instructional drills that train students to identify logically coherent continuations in text passages.

**Your Goal:** Generate 1 unique 'Foundational Drill' that teaches ONE specific logical reasoning skill needed to solve the Target Scenario below.

---

**Target Scenario:**
- **Context:** {th_ctx}
- **Possible Endings:**
{th_endings}

---

### **Core Skills to Train**

Choose ONE of these logical flow skills to focus your drill on:

1. **Coherence & Continuity** - Does the ending flow naturally from the context? Does it maintain topic consistency?

2. **Plausibility & Practicality** - Is the continuation realistic and actionable? Does it make common sense?

3. **Information Progression** - Does the ending add new, useful information without redundancy? Does it advance the narrative?

4. **Cause-Effect Reasoning** - Does the ending logically follow from what was set up in the context? Are there implicit contradictions?

5. **Specificity vs. Abstraction** - Does the level of detail match what's expected? If context is general, do substeps provide specifics?

---

### **Drill Design Instructions**

The Drill Questions MUST be different from the target question. Do not make anything that resembles that target's specific scenario.

**Drill Question Goal:** Present a focused question that isolates ONE of the core skills above. Use contrastive examples - show 3~5 endings (including correct and incorrect ones) and ask the student to identify one answer and WHY.

**Key Requirements:**
- Focus on LOGICAL FLOW reasoning, not surface features
- Use explicit contrastive examples (good vs. bad)
- Aim for challenging difficulty (80-90% complexity of original)

### **Thai Language Quality Guidelines**

All drills must be written in high-quality, natural Thai, following correct grammar, official terminology, and cultural context suitable for educational material.

---

### **Generation Rules & Output Format**

1. **Originality:** Create a NEW drill scenario. Do not just copy the target scenario. You may use the same context but must create your own comparison questions.

2. **No Errors:** Ensure logical consistency. The correct answer must be genuinely correct with clear reasoning.

3. **Explicit Reasoning:** Reference answers must explain the logical principles, not just state correctness.

4. **JSON Output:** Your output MUST be a single, valid JSON object inside `<JSON_OUTPUT>` tags.

```

### **Internal Thought Process**

Before generating, think through:

1. **Analyze Target Scenario:** What makes the correct ending right? What logical principle does it exemplify?

2. **Identify Key Flaw in Wrong Endings:** Pick 2-4 wrong endings. What specific logical errors do they make? (redundancy? implausibility? structural mismatch? off-topic?)

3. **Choose Core Skill:** Which of the 5 core skills best captures the distinction? Focus the drill on teaching that ONE skill.

4. **Design Drill Question:** Create a comparison question using actual endings from the target. Ask student to identify the better one and explain the logical flow difference.

5. **Write Reference Answers:** Provide thorough explanations that teach the logical reasoning pattern explicitly. Use phrases like:
   - "มีความสอดคล้อง..." (coherent because...)
   - "ขาดความต่อเนื่องทางตรรกะ..." (lacks logical continuity because...)
   - "ส่งต่อข้อมูลโดย..." (progresses information by...)
   - "ขัดแย้งกับบริบทใน..." (contradicts the context in terms of...)

6. **Self-Critique:** Does this drill teach a generalizable skill for identifying logical flow? Will solving this drill genuinely help with the target scenario?
